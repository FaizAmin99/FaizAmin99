Hello, World! 👋
Welcome to my little coding corner! 🌟 I'm your friendly neighborhood DevOps escapee turned full-stack developer! ⚡️

About Me 😄

🔭 I'm currently crafting wonders with Full-Stack Development.
🌱 Learning React, MongoDB, Express.js, and Node.js like a code-hungry plant.
💻 Turning coffee into code since... well, my internship. Let's not count the years, shall we? 😅
🧳 Exploring the far reaches of technology, one commit at a time.
🎮 Gaming aficionado and part-time CS GO pro. I craft epic campaigns and slay bugs, virtual and otherwise.
